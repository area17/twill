# Storage Provider

The media and files libraries currently support S3, Azure and local storage. Head over to the `twill` configuration file to setup your storage disk and configurations. Also check out the direct upload section of this documentation to setup your IAM users and bucket / container if you want to use S3 or Azure as a storage provider.
