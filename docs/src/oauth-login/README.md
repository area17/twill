# Oauth Login

You can enable the `twill.enabled.users-oauth` feature to let your users login to the CMS using a third party service supported by Laravel Socialite.
By default, `twill.oauth.providers` only has `google`, but you are free to change it or add more services to it.
In the case of using Google, you would of course need to provide the following environment variables:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=https://admin.twill-based-cms.com/login/oauth/callback/google
```
