Twill packages are still pretty new, if you have suggestions please let us know by submitting an issue or pull request!

Packages are a great way to add or create reusable functionality to your twill project.

A package self-registers, and can contain Capsules.

Packages are composer installable.

In the following section we will explain how you can create your own package.
