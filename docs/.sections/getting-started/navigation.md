### Navigation

The `config/twill-navigation.php` file manages the navigation of your custom admin console. Using Twill's UI, the package provides 3 levels of navigation: global, primary and secondary. This file simply contains a nested array description of your navigation.

Each entry is defined by multiple options.
The simplest entry has a `title` and a `route` option which is a Laravel route name. A global entry can define a `primary_navigation` array that will contain more entries. A primary entry can define a `secondary_navigation` array that will contain even more entries.

Two other options are provided that are really useful in conjunction with the CRUD modules you'll create in your application: `module` and `can`. `module` is a boolean to indicate if the entry is routing to a module route. By default it will link to the index route of the module you used as your entry key. `can` allows you to display/hide navigation links depending on the current user and permission name you specify.

Example:

```php
<?php

return [
    'pages' => [
        'title' => 'Pages',
        'module' => true,
    ],
    'work' => [
        'title' => 'Work',
        'route' => 'admin.work.projects.index',
        'primary_navigation' => [
            'projects' => [
                'title' => 'Projects',
                'module' => true,
            ],
            'clients' => [
                'title' => 'Clients',
                'module' => true,
            ],
            'industries' => [
                'title' => 'Industries',
                'module' => true,
            ],
            'studios' => [
                'title' => 'Studios',
                'module' => true,
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

To make it work properly and to get active states automatically in Twill's UI, you should structure your routes in the same way like the example here:

```php
<?php

Route::module('pages');

Route::group(['prefix' => 'work'], function () {
    Route::module('projects');
    Route::module('clients');
    Route::module('industries');
    Route::module('studios');
});
```
