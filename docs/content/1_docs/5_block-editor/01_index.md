# Block Editor

The block editor is a dynamic, drag and drop interface giving users a lot of flexibility in adding and changing content for a given entry. For instance, if you have a module for creating work case studies (as we do in [our demo](https://demo.twill.io/)), you can use the block editor to create, arrange, and edit blocks of images and text, or anything else you can think of really, as they would appear in a page. You can create any number of different block types, each with a unique form that can be accessed directly within the block editor.

Below, we describe the process of creating a block editor and connecting it to your module.

Here is an overview of the process, each of which is detailed below.

1. Include the block editor form field in your module's form
2. Create and define blocks
3. Make sure you use blocks traits in your Model and Repository
