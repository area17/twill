# Storage Provider

The media and files libraries currently support S3, Azure and local storage. Head over to the `twill` configuration file to set up your storage disk and [configurations](./../2_getting-started/3_configuration.md#content-media-library). Also check out the [direct upload section](./06_s3-direct-uploads.md) of this documentation to set up your IAM users and bucket / container if you want to use S3 or Azure as a storage provider.
