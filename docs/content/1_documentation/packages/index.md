Packages are a great way to add or create reusable functionality to your twill project.

At its base, a Twill package is just a Laravel package but starting from the `TwillPackageServiceProvider`.

A package self-registers, and can contain Capsules.

Packages are composer installable.

In the following section we will explain how you can create your own package.
