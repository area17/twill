# About Twill

Twill is an open source Laravel package that helps developers rapidly create a custom CMS that is beautiful, powerful, and flexible. By standardizing common functions without compromising developer control, Twill makes it easy to deliver a feature-rich admin console that focuses on modern publishing needs.

Twill is an [AREA 17](https://area17.com) product. It was crafted with the belief that content management should be a creative, productive, and enjoyable experience for both publishers and developers.
