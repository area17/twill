# About Twill

Twill is an open source Laravel package that helps developers rapidly create a custom CMS that is beautiful, powerful, and flexible. By standardizing common functions without compromising developer control, Twill makes it easy to deliver a feature-rich admin console that focuses on modern publishing needs.

Twill is an [AREA 17](https://area17.com) product. It was crafted with the belief that content management should be a creative, productive, and enjoyable experience for both publishers and developers.

# Benefits overview

With a vast number of pre-built features and custom-built Vue.js UI components, developers can focus their efforts on the unique aspects of their applications instead of rebuilding standard ones. 

Built to get out of your way, Twill offers:
* No lock-in, create your data models or hook existing ones
* No front-end assumptions, use it within your Laravel app or headless
* No bloat, turn off features you don’t need
* No need to write/adapt HTML for the admin UI
* No limits, extend as you see fit
