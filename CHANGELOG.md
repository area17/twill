## 1.2.0 2018-09-24

It's been an exciting first few months for Twill, and along the way, we've been listening to your [feedback](http://github.com/area17/twill/issues). Today, we're excited to release Twill 1.2 with easier setup, improved documentation, and several improvements. We also happily welcomed our first external contribution from @yanhao-li and a lot of research on extensibility from @IllyaMoskvin!

[Breaking changes](#changed) have been kept to a minimum and we've provided configuration variables for backward compatibility. 

Reminder: Twill's versioning scheme maintains the following convention: `paradigm.major.minor`, exactly like Laravel. Fun fact: this is called [Romantic Versioning](http://blog.legacyteam.info/2015/12/romver-romantic-versioning/)! When referencing Twill from your application, you should always use a version constraint such as `1.2.*`, since major releases of Twill do include breaking changes.

### Fixed

- Media field: fix canvas based cropped thumbnail (make sure it is working on Chrome and Firefox, still fallbacking to the original thumbnail on Safari because of lack of support for tainted canvas with CORS)

### Improved

- Case insensitive search when using Postgres (47a64c1)

### Fixed

This is to avoid conflicts with arbitrary npm setups in hosts projects
(like a project running on Webpack 4, which is not compatible with Laravel Mix as of April 2018). 
Provided NPM scripts have been modified to use a simple copy command. 
This means the CMS build is fully independent from the project build. 
It also gives up a slight performance boost in HMR mode when developing.
