# Changelog

All notable changes to `twill` will be documented in this file.

## 1.2.2 (2019-08-21)

Twill just surpassed 10k [installs](https://packagist.org/packages/area17/twill/stats) and today, version 1.2.2 is available with a significant amount of improvements and bug fixes thanks to the efforts of 19 contributors: Amr Noman, Antoine Doury, Antonin Caudron, Antonio Carlos Ribeiro, Bram Mittendorff, Dmitrii Larionov, Fernando Petrelli, Franca Winter, Gilbert Moufflet, Jarred Bishop, Lorren Gordon, Pablo Barrios, Quentin Renard, Rafael Milewski, Ray Tri, Riaan Laubscher, Stevan PavloviÄ‡, Yanhao Li, Å½iga Pavlin.

**Glide support for local image rendering**

[Glide](https://glide.thephpleague.com) is an open source image rendering service that integrates well with Twill and Laravel. It is a self-hosted option for local development and/or production websites and apps that have limited needs for image resizing and cropping. For image-heavy production websites and apps, we still recommend [Imgix](https://imgix.com) or a similar third party service, or at least setting up a CDN on top of your images.

The media and file libraries `local` endpoint type has also been completely reworked to work with Laravel default public storage location. Remember to run `php artisan storage:link` locally and as part of your deployment process if you are using local uploads rather than S3.

To try out Glide on a fresh Twill app, it is as simple as updating 2 environment variables:

```
MEDIA_LIBRARY_ENDPOINT_TYPE=local
MEDIA_LIBRARY_IMAGE_SERVICE=A17\Twill\Services\MediaLibrary\Glide
```

Of course, more configuration variables are available through the new `glide` key of Twill's configuration. See the default configuration [here](https://github.com/area17/twill/blob/1.2/config/glide.php).

**Making repeaters happy again**

Repeaters had a couple of issues that are now fixed in this release:

* repeaters in forms are now updating the initially created database record instead of needlessly creating a new record each time their parent model gets updated
* repeaters in blocks are now restored correctly when restoring a past revision
* medias and files fields support has been improved

**Different images per language support**

You can now globally enable the ability for your content editors to provide different images per language in the media form field using the `media_library.translated_form_fields` configuration key (defaults to `false`). The user experience is exactly the same as our other translatable field. When rendering in a template or API, you can fallback to the default language if no image has been selected for the current language.

**Cleaning up internals**

Lead by community member [Stevan PavloviÄ‡](https://github.com/stevanpavlovic), an effort to clean Twill internals begins with this release. Laravel helpers and facades are getting replaced by dependency injection or at least, for now, to avoid consequent breaking changes, by fully qualified imports.

**And a lot more in the changelog below!**

**HOW TO UPDATE**

To update, you will need to run `composer update` in your project and then run the new Twill provided artisan command: `twill:update`. This will generates new database migrations and invite you to migrate your database. Those new migrations are safe to run as they check for the existence (or inexistence) of tables and columns in your database before doing anything. If you are upgrading from an earlier version than `1.2`, you will need to update your `composer.json` file first: `"area17/twill": "1.2.*"`.

**NOTE ABOUT UPCOMING LARAVEL 6 AND SEMANTIC VERSIONING**

Laravel 6 upcoming release was [announced](https://laravel-news.com/laravel-v6-announcement) a few weeks ago at [Laracon US](https://laracon.us)! Twill will of course support it soon after the official release, which should happen at the end of August at [Laracon EU](https://laracon.eu) ðŸ¤ž.

Taylor Otwell also explained why v6 instead of v5.9 since the next release is not a paradigm shift for the framework: Laravel is adopting [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (`major.minor.patch`) and for simplicity, we will make that shift as well.

Right now, Laravel and Twill are following [romantic versioning](http://blog.legacyteam.info/2015/12/romver-romantic-versioning/) (`paradigm.major.minor`). This is why Twill 1.2.2 is not just about patches but new features and improvements too. 

Moving forward, once Laravel 6 is released, a release with breaking changes will be considered major, which would mean Twill 2.0.0 right now. A release with new features would be 1.3.0, and patches would be 1.2.3. 

You can start using Composer's [caret version range](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#caret-version-range-) (`^1.2.2`) now if you'd like to benefit from new features without fearing breaking changes on your next `composer update`! If you'd rather stick to a stricter way of requiring Twill versions (fair enough, we do that in Twill's npm dependencies for your own safety), you will have to update your `composer.json` file to get new features rather than patches only.

## 1.2.0 2018-09-24

It's been an exciting first few months for Twill, and along the way, we've been listening to your [feedback](http://github.com/area17/twill/issues). Today, we're excited to release Twill 1.2 with easier setup, improved documentation, and several improvements. We also happily welcomed our first external contribution from @yanhao-li and a lot of research on extensibility from @IllyaMoskvin!

[Breaking changes](#changed) have been kept to a minimum and we've provided configuration variables for backward compatibility. 

Reminder: Twill's versioning scheme maintains the following convention: `paradigm.major.minor`, exactly like Laravel. Fun fact: this is called [Romantic Versioning](http://blog.legacyteam.info/2015/12/romver-romantic-versioning/)! When referencing Twill from your application, you should always use a version constraint such as `1.2.*`, since major releases of Twill do include breaking changes.

### Fixed

- Media field: fix canvas based cropped thumbnail (make sure it is working on Chrome and Firefox, still fallbacking to the original thumbnail on Safari because of lack of support for tainted canvas with CORS)

## 1.0.12 2018-04-19

### Improved

- Case insensitive search when using Postgres (47a64c1)

### Fixed

### Improved

- Drop laravel-mix requirement on host projects (!66)
```
This is to avoid conflicts with arbitrary npm setups in hosts projects
(like a project running on Webpack 4, which is not compatible with Laravel Mix as of April 2018). 
Provided NPM scripts have been modified to use a simple copy command. 
This means the CMS build is fully independent from the project build. 
It also gives up a slight performance boost in HMR mode when developing.
